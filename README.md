## CS

### Load testing

- [Coordinated Omission](https://www.scylladb.com/2021/04/22/on-coordinated-omission/) -- When the system under test is affecting the load generator and how to alleviate the issue and also correctly measure the latency of the test itself.
- [Browser based load testing](https://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/browser-based-load-testing/) -- This company was able to run 60000 browser tests using a JS script and Playwright for $100! Key takeaways:
    - Use spot instances,
    - Use AWS batch job,
    - Find cheapest region to run this test in,
    - multiple browser sessions per batch job (so 10 browser sessions per browser processes).
